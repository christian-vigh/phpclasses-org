<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>
	Extracting text from PDF files can be a tedious task for a developer. If you ever tried to open a PDF file using a text editor such
	as <i>Notepad++</i> just to perform a simple search on some text you know for sure to be present in it, chances are great that you will find nothing
	but binary data !
</p>

<p>
	This is due to the open nature of the PDF file format : the basic elements of a PDF file are <i>objects</i>, identified by a
	(normally) unique object number and a revision id. Objects can contain anything like font definitions, character substitution tables and,
	of course, text data, most of them being in <i>gzip</i> format, when not encrypted... And expect even more complicated things under the hood.
</p>

<p>
	This article explains how the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/package/9732-PHP-Extract-text-contents-from-PDF-files.html" title="PdfToText" alt="PdfToText" target="_blank">PdfToText</a> class
	can help you to extract text from almost any PDF file.<br />
</p>

<p>
	It will be followed by a series of articles explaining various parts of the PDF file format that are of interest during the text extraction process.
</p>


<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>
	Talking about an installation process would be a little bit pretentious : just extract the <b>PdfToText.phpclass</b> file from the <i>.zip</i> archive to your preferred
	includes directory.
</p>

<p>
	A future version may include additional and completely optional satellit data files, but that's another story which will be the subject of another article...
</p>

<h3>Generating PDF files</h3>

<p>
	Before starting working with the <b>PdfToText</b> class, you will need of course a few PDF sample files ; if you do not have any one at hand, two or three are provided 
	in the <b>PdfToText</b> <i>.zip</i> package, under the <i>examples</i> directory. <br />
	If you're using the Windows operating system, the following virtual printer drivers can be of some help to generate PDF files 
	(the following list is not exhaustive) :

	<ul>
		<li>
			<i>Microsoft Print to PDF</i> : the native solution from Microsoft. If not installed on your system, you can have a look s
			<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/microsoft-print-to-pdf-missing-from-printer/e60d68b2-f530-4a9f-a31b-a87355625fae?auth=1"
					target="_blank"
				>here</a>.
			Note that it may sometimes generate weird results...
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Pdf Creator</i> : a free virtual printer (<a href="http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfcreator" target="_blank">http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfcreator</a>). 
			The free version contains some ads.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>PrimoPdf</i> : another free virtual PDF printer (<a href="http://www.primopdf.com" target="_blank">http://www.primopdf.com</a>).
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Pdf Architect 4</i> : Another product from PdfForge, which is not free (<a href="http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfarchitect" target="_blank">http://www.pdfforge.org/pdfarchitect</a>). 
			However, it includes a free virtual PDF printer driver really similar to <i>Pdf Creator</i> (if not identical, except the name).
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>Pdf Pro 10</i> : A not-free solution for editing PDF files (<a href="http://www.pdfpro10.com" target="_blank">http://www.pdfpro10.com</a>). 
			It includes a free virtual printer driver that has many interesting features, such as an elaborate printer spooler for managing files printed on servers. 
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>PdFill Image Writer</i> : A free virtual printer (<a href="https://www.pdfill.com/freewriter.html" target="_blank">https://www.pdfill.com/freewriter.html</a>).
			You can also purchase a PDF editor for less than 20$.
		</li>
		<li>
			And, of course, <i>Adobe Acrobat DC</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	You can also use Microsoft Word (>= 2007), OpenOffice and LibreOffice to save your documents as PDF files.
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>
	Although the PDF file format is really versatile, the <b>PdfToText</b> class has been designed to hide you the complexity of the underlying data and provide 
	a simple interface. Basically, the simplest PHP script that would process a PDF file given as a command-line argument
	and echo its text contents to the standard output would look like this :

	<pre class="code">
		&lt;?php
			require ('path/to/PdfToText.phpcass' ) ;

			$pdf		=  new  PdfToText ( $argv [1] ) ;
			echo $pdf -> Text ;
	</pre>

	Once you have loaded a PDF file, its text contents are accessible through the <b>Text</b> property.

	The filename supplied to the class constructor is optional ; you can omit it, then later use the <i>Load()</i> method to extract its contents. 
	This allows you to specify additional options or set special properties before loading the actual PDF contents ; the following example will extract
	images from your PDF file, by setting the <i>Options</i> property before calling the <i>Load()</i> method :

	<pre class="code">
		&lt;?php
			require ('path/to/PdfToText.phpcass' ) ;

			$pdf			=  new  PdfToText ( ) ;
			$pdf -> Options		=  PdfToText::PDFOPT_DECODE_IMAGE_DATA ;
			$pdf -> Load ( $argv [1] ) ;
			echo $pdf -> Text ;
	</pre>

	Note that this second approach will allow you to reuse the same object (with the same options) for processing different PDF files.
</p>

<h3>Retrieving page contents</h3>

<p>
	You can retrieve individual page contents by using the <b>Pages</b> array property which is available, like the <b>Text</b> property, once the PDF file contents have been loaded.
</p>
<p>
	The <b>Pages</b> property is an associative array whose keys are page numbers, and values, page contents.
</p>
<p>
	A sample script which would display individual page contents from a PDF file would look like this :

	<pre class="code">
		&lt;?php
			require ('path/to/PdfToText.phpcass' ) ;

			$pdf		=  new  PdfToText ( $argv [1] ) ;
		
			foreach  ( $pdf -> Pages  as  $page_number => $page_contents )
				echo "Contents of page #$page_number :\n$page_contents\n" ;
	</pre>
</p>

<h3>Retrieving image data</h3>

<p>
	The PDF file format supports several types of images contents. In its current version (1.2.46), the <b>PdftoText</b> class is only able to process
	images encoded in the JPEG format.
</p>

<p>
	Retrieving image contents is a simple as specifying a special option as the second parameter of the class constructor :

	<pre class="code">
		&lt;?php
			require ('path/to/PdfToText.phpcass' ) ;

			$pdf			=  new  PdfToText ( $argv [1], PdfToText::PDFOPT_DECODE_IMAGE_DATA ) ;
	</pre>

	Or, if you prefer deferred loading :

	<pre class="code">
		&lt;?php
			require ('path/to/PdfToText.phpcass' ) ;

			$pdf			=  new  PdfToText ( ) ;
			$pdf -> Options		=  PdfToText::PDFOPT_DECODE_IMAGE_DATA ;
			$pdf -> Load ( $argv [1] ) ;
	</pre>

	Once loaded, image contents will be available through the <b>Images</b> array property, hich is an array of image resources which
	have been created for each JPEG image encountered in your PDF file.
</p>

<p>
	There is another option, <i>PdfToText::PDFOPT_GET_IMAGE_DATA</i>, which simply loads raw image data into the <b>ImageData</b> array property. In this
	way, you may have more elements in the <b>ImageData</b> property than in <b>Images</b>, since the <b>PdfToText</b> class currently supports only
	JPEG images.
</p>
<p>
	Note that specifying the <i>PDF_DECODE_IMAGE_DATA</i> flag automatically sets the <i>PDFOPT_GET_IMAGE_DATA</i> one.
</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>
	You will find below a link to the complete Adobe PDF specifications version 1.7 :

<p>
	If you're enough enthusiastic to read the 1300 pages of this document,
	keep in mind that Adobe also provided a generous set of technical notes addressing various specific topics not completely
	covered by these specifications. Some of these technical notes are more than 200 pages long...
</p>

<h3>How to contribute to the development of the PdfToText class</h3>

<p>
	There are so many ways to write the same page contents using the Adobe Postcript-like language that sometimes you may get strange results ; should this be the case, 
	please feel free to contact me on the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/discuss/package/9732/" target="_blank">Support forum</a>.
</p>
<p>
	You can also have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/christian-vigh-phpclasses/PdfToText" target="_blank">Github repository</a>, and even issue pull requests.
	I also have a website dedicated for this class : <a href="http://www.pdftotext.eu" target="_blank">http://www.pdftotext.eu</a>.
</p>
<p>
	However, if you have any issue while processing one of your PDF files, and really don't want to go through the code to try to understand what's happening,
	you can reach me directly at : <a href="mailto: christian.vigh@wuthering-bytes.com">christian.vigh@wuthering-bytes.com</a>.
	Just send me the faulty PDF file as an attachment together with a little description about the issue, and I will be happy to try to solve your problem.
</p>

<h3>Known issues</h3>

<p>
	The following is a list of known issues. I'm still working on them and they will normally be implemented in future versions :

	<ul>
		<li>RTL languages, such as Arabic, Hebrew or Syriac, are not correctly processed : they are extracted from left to right</li>
		<li>Only JPEG images are currently supported</li>
		<li>There is currently no support for password-protected files (note that I'm not intending to develop a password cracker !
			just a feature that allows you to extract text contents from a password-encrypted PDF file, if you supply the correct password)
		</li>
		<li>Digitally signed files are not currently supported</li>
		<li>Text contents may sometimes show badly translated characters. The reason why will be explained in the next series of articles</li>
		<li>The extracted text contents may not exactly reflect text positioning on the page. This is especially true regarding PDF files
			that contain data in tabular format. Again, this issue will be fixed in a future release and explained in one of the future
			articles about this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			CID fonts (Adobe internal fonts, mainly targeted at eastern languages and developed before the Unicode effort took place) are
			not yet supported. This will be the subject of another article.
		</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

class. It presented a few features of the class, gave some basic examples on how to use it, and listed its current development state.
</p>

<p>
	More articles will follow, diving into the internals of the PDF file format and explaining how the <b>PdfToText</b> class tries to handle them. The next article will talk about
	how the text is "drawn" on a page, and the various encoding styles that can be used to draw characters.
