			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<div>Some time ago I had the need to go farther than what PHP can offer regarding regular expressions. I wanted to analyze log file contents, each line being matched by a specific regular expression. I wanted that a single regular expression could be used to match a sequence of lines in a logfile using some kind of <b>meta-matching</b>.</div>
			<div>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>This article explains the basic knowledge about regular expressions that was needed to achieve that goal. It describes the intermediate methods that I built as steps towards meta-matching.</div>
			<div>
				<br>
			</div>
			<div>Then it introduces this so-called &quot;meta-matching&quot; feature that allows you to describe text flows as sequences of meta-regular expressions involving themselves their own sets of regular expressions provided to match particular lines of text.</div>
			<h2>The Beginning Problem</h2>
			Let's suppose you have to scan a sequence of lines, such as in a log file. You want to	recognize which sequence follows which pattern.

			A typical sequence in an example log file could be, for example:
			<ul>
				<li>A line containing the string &quot;<i>message start</i>&quot;</li>
				<li>
					Any number of lines starting with &quot;<i>log:</i>&quot; and followed by any sequence of characters
				</li>
				<li>A line containing &quot;<i>message end</i>&quot;</li>
			</ul>

			The following example gives a layout of how such a log file could look like:x<br><pre class="code">message start
log: message 1<br>log: message 2<br>...<br>log: message n<br>message end<br></pre>

			The idea behind that is to say:
			<ul>
				<li>Ok, I want to match the string &quot;message start&quot;, and every string that starts with &quot;message&quot; and ends up with a number ; and I also want to match strings that contain &quot;message end&quot;</li>
				<li>
					But... wait... these sequences of strings can also be described by a regular expression ! If I could be able to say :
					<ul>
						<li>I'm expecting the string &quot;message start&quot; as the first line</li>
						<li>Then, any number of lines containing the word &quot;log&quot; followed a number</li>
						<li>And finally, a line containing &quot;message end&quot;</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			Wouldn't it be better if it could be described using a regular expression ?<br>

			<h2>The Concept of Meta Regular Expression Matching</h2><p>
				Let's say that the sequence \1 references a regular expression that matches the string &quot;message start&quot;, \2 is a reference to an expression that matches the string &quot;log:&quot; followed by a number, and \3 a reference to a regular expression that matches the string &quot;message end&quot;.
			</p><p>Matching our example input stream with a single&nbsp;<i>meta</i> regular expression could be written as:</p><div>

<pre class="code">\1 \2* \3
</pre>

				<p>This means : a line containing &quot;message start&quot;, followed by any number of lines containing the word &quot;log&quot; followed by an integer, and ending with a line containing &quot;message end&quot;.</p><p>
					You're done! You just learned how to do <i>meta regular expression</i> matching. Although you do not yet know how to tell that &quot;\1&quot; is intended to match the string &quot;message start&quot;, &quot;\2&quot; the string &quot;log&quot; followed by an integer, and so on, you have moved a step forward in the direction of <i>meta-thinking</i> (the term is humbly mine), which is an activity of choice for so many mathematicians and developers.
				</p><h2>The PHP Advanced Regex package</h2><p>
					The <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/package/9336.html">PHP&nbsp;Advanced Regex package</a> is here to relieve you from the burden of this <i>meta-something</i> stuff.
				</p><p>If you feel uncomfortable with basic regular expressions, may I recommend you to read the next part of this article which is basically a<i>&nbsp;survival guide to regular expressions?</i></p><p>Although it is not intended to provide a thorough coverage on how to be a regular expression superstar, it explains some basic concepts, introduces some habits I have taken in PHP when writing regular expressions and that saved me a lot of time.</p><p>It also contains some stuff to explain how to get proper match results from applying a regular expression to input strings. The last two items belong more to common sense rather than to rigid coding rules.&nbsp;</p>
			</div><div>
				<h2>Conclusion</h2><p>In this part of the article you learned how to think about meta regular expression matching to match complex text sequences.</p><p>In the next part you will be guided you through basic rules for using regular expressions. It will detail the intermediary utility methods that have been implemented in the <a href="http://www.phpclasses.org/package/9336-PHP-Match-MSDOS-UNIX-patterns-with-regular-expressions.html">PHP dvanced Regex package</a> to assist you into meta-regular expression matching.</p><p>
					The third and last part which will show you how to cope with meta-regular expression matching.
