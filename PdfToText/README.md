# INTRODUCTION #

The PdfToText class has been designed to extract textual contents from a PDF file.

It's pretty simple to use :

	include ( 'PdfToText.phpclass' ) ;

	$pdf 	=  new PdfToText ( 'sample.pdf' ) ;
	echo $pdf -> Text ; 		// or you could also write : echo ( string ) $pdf ;

The same PdfToText object can be reused to process additional files :

	$pdf -> Load ( 'sample2.pdf' ) ;
	echo $pdf -> Text ;

Look at the class' blog for an overview on the underlying mechanics that are involved into extracting text contents from pdf files.

Examples are also provided in the **examples/** directory. Please have a look at the [examples/README.md](examples/README.md "README.md") file for a brief explanation on their structure.


# KNOWN ISSUES #

Here is a list about known issues for the **PdfToText** class ;  I'm working on solving them, so I hope this whole paragraph will soon completely disappear !

- Unwanted line breaks may occur within text lines. This is due to the fact that the pdf file contains drawing instructions that use relative positioning. This is especially true for generators such as **PdfCreator**
-  A pdf file is made from objects ; every object has a type but, although rare, some of them are mistakenly taken for text-drawing instructions
-  Fonts using **/ToUnicode** character maps are correctly handled. However, the **/Encoding** mapping still needs to be implemented. This is especially true if you generate your pdf files using the **PrimoPdf** or **PdfPro** virtual printers.
