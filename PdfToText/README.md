# INTRODUCTION #

The PdfToText class has been designed to extract textual contents from a PDF file.

It's pretty simple to use :

	include ( 'PdfToText.phpclass' ) ;

	$pdf 	=  new PdfToText ( 'sample.pdf' ) ;
	echo $pdf -> Text ; 		// or you could also write : echo ( string ) $pdf ;

The same PdfToText object can be reused to process additional files :

	$pdf -> Load ( 'sample2.pdf' ) ;
	echo $pdf -> Text ;

Look at the class' blog for an overview on the underlying mechanics that are involved into extracting text contents from pdf files.

Examples are also provided in the **examples/** directory. Please have a look at the [examples/README.md](examples/README.md "README.md") file for a brief explanation on their structure.

**IMPORTANT** : the **PdfToText** class generates UTF8-encoded text.

# FEATURES #

Text rendering in a PDF file is made using an obscure language which provides multiple ways to position the same text at the same location on a page. You could say for example :

	. Goto coordinates (x,y)
	. Render text ( "Mail : someone@somewhere.com" )

Or :

	. Goto next line
	. Goto (x1,y)
	. Render text ( "Mail" )
	. Goto (x2, y) 
	. Render text ( ":" )
	. Goto (x3, y)
	. Render text ( "someone@somewhere.com" )

(note that I'm using a pseudo-language here).
Both pieces of code would probably display the same text at the same position, by using rather different ways.

This is why the **PdfToText** class tracks the following information from the drawing-instruction stream to provide more accurate text rendering (even if the output is only pure text) :

- The currently selected font is tracked. This is important because :

	- Each font in a PDF file can have its own character map. This means in this case that characters to be drawn using the Adobe language do not specify actual character codes, but an index into the font's character map.
	- The current font size is memorized ; this helps to evaluate what is the current y-coordinate when relative positioning instructions are used (such as "goto next line"). Although approximative, this works in a great majority of cases
	
- If multiple strings are rendered using identical y-coordinate, they will be grouped onto the same line. Note that they must appear sequentially in the instruction flow for this trick to work
- Sub/super-scripted text is usually written at a slightly different y-coordinate than the line it appears in. Such a situation is detected, and the sub/super-scripted text will correctly appear onto the same line


# KNOWN ISSUES #

Here is a list about known issues for the **PdfToText** class ;  I'm working on solving them, so I hope this whole paragraph will soon completely disappear !

- Unwanted line breaks may occur within text lines. This is due to the fact that the pdf file contains drawing instructions that use relative positioning. This is especially true for file created with generators such as **PdfCreator**. However, some provisions have been made to try to track put text with roughly the same y-coordinates onto the same line
- Encrypted PDF files are not supported 
- Protected regions are not supported. This can pause a problem in text rendering if a referenced font declaration is located in a protected region, because the **PdfToText** class will not be aware that such a font exists, and therefore won't be able to perform character translations because it could not associate a character map with it (by "protected regions", I mean "Binary PDF object data that I really don't know how to interpret"). However, you can still use tools such as *PdfCreator*, *PrimoPdf* or *PDF Pro* to print the PDF file, then run  the **PdfToText** class to extract textual contents, which will this time be fully accessible.

# TESTING #

I have tested this class against dozens of documents from various origins, and tested the output generated from each sample document by the *PdfCreator*, *PrimoPdf* and *PDF Pro* tools.

I also compared the output of the **PdfToText** class with that of *Acrobat Reader*, when you choose the *Save as...Text* option. In many situations, the class performs better in positioning the final text than *Acrobat Reader* does.  

However, all of that will not guarantee that it will work in every situation ; so, if you find something weird or not functioning properly using the **PdfToText** class, feel free to contact me on this class' blog, and send me a sample PDF file at the following email address :
